Project Aim and Focus:

HaBaby strives to connect pregnant refugees with relevant medical information. It lists common symptoms, searchable by trimester, actions to take, and what to tell your doctor, and supports multiple languages - Arabic and English to start - with a focus on visual communication. It also includes information on pre- and post-natal care. The app can be utilized in places with low bandwidth, with most of the functionality accessible offline once initially downloaded. The name came from combining the Arabic word “habibi” (sweetheart) and baby.

The current focus of the HaBaby project is to create an initial pilot version that meets the needs of several key populations, including pregnant women who are transient refugees as well as Arabic-speaking women in the UK. After conducting a technical review of similar existing apps and a content review with our clinical advisors, we will design and develop a version that can be piloted in March. User feedback generated from partners and potential users will inform further development post the Global Health Hackathon in April.
